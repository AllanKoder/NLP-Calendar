# AI Calendar
## A NLP Calendar that can input dates and events with only text

Without the hassle of having to manually move events and select UI, users can type in their request and allow the machine to do the work
It can classify:
* events as exercise, work, health or leisure.
* todo, events or reminders
* text in any format, ex: alarm at 4pm. Exercise from the morning to noon
